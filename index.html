			I keep the memory of your skin and the texture of your voice stored in the
			locker of your absence (labeled OCT 12 2019), preserving it with the
			utmost care. There are voicemails I dare not delete. I’ve thought about
			bringing your photo to someone who can age-advance it, the way they do for
			missing persons, so I can know what you look like as I encounter my own
			rites of passage (ones I thought you would attend.) You are missing
			(perpetually,) however, I could speculate what you look like in the skin
			of a man who is 65 instead of 61. Even still, I don’t know that you
			remember what you look like on this side of life--the only one I currently
			have.
			<span class="highlight"
				>That is the tear in death, the failure for you to exist as the image of
				Dad for both of us, and my failure to understand what you are now. </span
			>You were the olive complexioned, balding, and blue-eyed man of my
			childhood. I don’t know anymore, and I can’t, because you are not here.
			(If “you” is even the right word to use at this time.) <br />
		</div>
		<div class="text-block" id="two">
			There is a physicality I dream of in the afterlife. It’s a fantasy tied so
			deeply to the endearing and misguided features of being human: accessing
			the memory of my body. Who am I once I have died? With God’s search engine
			I plan to track the whispers of myself in the world post-mortem: who
			speaks my name, who cries out to me, who jerks off to me, etc. My desire
			to know the truth of myself in the architecture of the world finally
			appeased--from a place of objectivity impossible with my current
			existence. The problem is that death is, as far as I know, a finality. It
			is not a rite of passage but a certainty of life. One that removes who I
			am from what I inhabit. I don’t get to keep a body after I die. I won’t
			remember it, either. Concoct yourself versioned in death. Do you ever
			split your skin from your soul? <br />
		</div>
		<div class="text-block" id="three">
			“I am here and then I’m not.” That’s what my dad said to me when I asked
			him where he would go when he died. He pointed to the ground, looked up at
			me holding my eyes with his, and stomped the imaginary ant he traced the
			path of before his chair. I try to replicate the ant’s point of view: a
			lurking shadow cast over the linoleum meadow, a hint of pressure, a broken
			neck. What is a pretend ant’s heaven? Did my dad go there too? <br />
		</div>
		<div class="text-block">
			I take my most crafted, inset, true visualizations of the afterlife and
			bring them to an image. The most vivid picture I can test unwinds
			symbolically mostly because the identifiers I have created to understand
			life after death can only exist in earthbound images. A cloud, a parallel
			universe where Emily is brunette and I’m a blonde, a reunion with the blue
			eyes of my father. My fictitious ant’s heaven starts to seem much more
			authentic than anything I could forge; his heaven is perhaps more real
			than my own. 
		</div>
		<div class="text-block" id="four">
			The threads I weave make a moth eaten tapestry of what life after death
			is. The strings are too short—they get pulled through the interlocking
			weft and warp before the picture appears, only to fall into balls of
			twisted yarn on the floor. As soon as I’ve made up my mind about where I
			am going in the next life, I disappear from there. Neither heaven’s
			address nor the finality of my image is mine to decide. To place myself
			anywhere outside of this life inside of this body doesn’t make sense, to
			place myself outside of this moment just as much. The problem remains:
			solving what the image is, my image, which will never be solved. <br />
		</div>
		<div class="text-block" id="five">
			I found the note I wrote a while ago, it’s in a binder labeled “smile
			file.” I don’t remember what it said, only that it made me cry and
			presented the prodigious desire to return to a time when death meant
			anything I wanted it to. An interventionist at my school had asked me
			weeks before, “if you could drive away and start a new life would it
			relieve the urge to kill yourself?” A new life implied something
			unrealized. What I don’t know continues to save my life.  <br />
		</div>
		<div class="text-block" id="six">
			It became apparent then that death would interfere with my life if I chose
			it. I could not go to the football game as an alive person if I were dead.
			I couldn’t go to Kiki’s party in my flesh if I died. I hoped I would find
			my way there in some different form, but I wouldn’t command attention as a
			person. Despite their profoundly nonspiritual nature, these scenes became
			reminders of the factors I could not account for in the afterlife. There
			is the experience of death once I have died, (an unknown for now,) and the
			imagined experience of my afterlife while I exist. My choice hinged on the
			idea that my evaluation of its functionality was correct: ending my life
			was the one way to revive myself, to reset everything I knew. To have the
			life I wanted I needed to die even with the understanding that being dead
			does not allow my life to continue. Can something be a solution to my
			problem if I’m not guaranteed to witness its resolve? <br />
		</div>
		<div class="text-block">
			I don’t know what my image is. My attempts at freezing the truth of my
			mirror consistently fall short. No photo has lasted long enough to outlive
			the lie. Sophia is happy, Sophia is sad, Sophia has found a new body to
			live inside of. Sophia has a cellphone that captures her at angles she
			both likes and disdains. I wish she would stay one way, because if she
			can’t—Sophia cannot live in this body any longer. Sophia does not know
			what any of those states look like anymore, and she never felt them to
			begin with, because an image is a very static thing to fix yourself to as
			a person. In the beginning I thought that if the photo was of me, then
			searching there would provide evidence of who I was. I theorized that in
			studying the image I could formulate the perspective of another; I could
			unlock the equation to fuse my relationship to life with the world’s
			experience of me. A truth.
			<br />
		</div>
		<div class="text-block">
			An image is what you believe anything to be, which it is inherently not,
			because it is only an image. <br />
		</div>
		<div class="text-block">
			I can measure the distance between an imagined life with him and the
			reality without. The calipers stretch between two parallel universes,
			inching apart as the days roll on. There are days I resent the sunshine,
			when I walk around and listen to my music a little too loud. I get struck.
			My knees buckle and I wilt my gaze to the concrete. <br />
		</div>
		<div class="text-block">
			Images format my partitions, ones that meter themselves with the same
			cadence of my development. An image is a guardrail for my reality, despite
			the gap it creates between me and the world. It is a reference point, a
			life raft, a mirage. If I can get them to look like they’re moving in sync
			(me and my image), then I’ve gotten everything I’ve ever wanted. I can
			reach out from my train to the one moving parallel and pretend I’m riding
			in the same car. Life is a checked-box and a way to feel forever. Life
			becomes certain in my convictions and the victory of their receptions. It
			is where reality meets fantasy and I can exist in two realms as someone
			fully understood. But the trains diverge once the image expires—my arms
			are no longer outstretched toward a dimly lit window. Instead my hands
			brush the walls of a dusty, black tunnel and I wonder where I’ve
			disappeared to.
			<br />
		</div>
		<!-- <div class="text-block">
			I want parameters. I want formulas and patterns and numbers and objectives
			to show me quantifiable data on my reception. I look in the mirror and she
			wants me to know how to evaluate it. Can I ever maintain my legibility in
			this world? <br />
